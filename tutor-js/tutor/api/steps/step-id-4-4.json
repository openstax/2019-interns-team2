Vary the velocity and acceleration by sliding the red and green markers along the scales. Keeping the velocity marker near zero will make the effect of acceleration more obvious. Try changing acceleration from positive to negative while the man is moving. We will come back to this animation and look at the “Charts” view when we study graphical representation of motion.</p><iframe src='https://archive.cnx.org/specials/e2ca52af-8c6b-450e-ac2f-9300b38e8739/moving-man/' width='960' height='560'></iframe></div>"
