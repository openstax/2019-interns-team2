Conserved through evolution in all organisms, nucleic acids store and transmit hereditary information. As will be explored in more detail in Chapters 14-17, DNA contains the instructions for the synthesis of proteins by dictating the sequences of amino acids in polypeptides through processes known as transcription and translation. Nucleic acids are made up of nucleotides; in turn, each nucleotide consists of a pentose sugar (deoxyribose in DNA and ribose in RNA), a nitrogenous base (adenine, cytosine, guanine, and thymine or uracil), and a phosphate group. DNA carries the genetic blueprint of the cell that is passed from parent to offspring via cell division. DNA has a double-helical structure with the two strands running in opposite directions (antiparallel), connected by hydrogen bonds and complementary to each other. In DNA, purines pair with pyrimidines: adenine pairs with thymine (A-T), and cytosine pairs with guanine (C-G). In RNA, uracil replaces thymine to pair with adenine (U-A). RNA also differs from DNA in that it is single-stranded and has many forms, such as messenger RNA (mRNA), ribosomal RNA (rRNA), and transfer RNA (tRNA) that all participate in the synthesis of proteins. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) regulate the use of mRNA. The flow of genetic information is usually DNA &#8594; RNA &#8594; protein, also known as the Central Dogma of Life.</p> <p id=\"fs-id1167066809227\" class=\"ost-reading-discard\">Information presented and the examples highlighted in the section support concepts and Learning Objectives outlined in Big Idea 3 and Big Idea 4 of the AP<sup>&#174;</sup> Biology Curriculum Framework.

Ask the students to imagine a rope ladder with the top of the right side labeled 3 and the other end of that side labeled 5. The top of the left side is labeled 5 and the other end 3, so the numbers are going in opposite directions on opposite sides of the ladder, giving the sides of the structure an antiparallel orientation. Now imagine grabbing the ladder from the top and twisting. That is a double helix. It is double because there are two sides to it. You might try to draw a ladder, with its labels; then, ask the students to imagine it twisting. Another possibility is to have students use pipe cleaners to build the double helix.</p> </div> <div data-type=\"note\" data-has-label=\"true\" id=\"fs-id1167067006116\" class=\"note ost-background-info\" data-label=\"Background Information\"> <p id=\"fs-id1167063512371\">RNA usually exists as a single strand.  Messenger RNA (mRNA) can be found in the nucleus, where it &#8220;mirrors&#8221; the sequence of nucleotides found in DNA, and in the cytoplasm, where it delivers its message to ribosomes for protein assembly. Ribosomes are made of ribosomal RNA (rRNA) and protein.  Transfer RNA (tRNA) carries amino acids to the ribosomes for attachment to a developing protein. MicroRNA (miRNA) are the smallest RNA molecules and their role involves the regulation of gene expression by interfering with the expression of certain mRNA.</p> <p id=\"fs-id1167067066451\">Some viruses contain double stranded RNA, but plants and animals do not.</p> </div> </div> <section data-depth=\"1\" id=\"fs-id1167067066457\" class=\"ost-tag-lo-apbio-ch03-s05-lo01 ost-get-exercise\"><h1 data-type=\"title\">DNA and RNA</h1> <p id=\"fs-id1876142\"><span data-type=\"term\">Nucleic acids</span> are the most important macromolecules for the continuity of life.

DNA is the genetic material found in all living organisms, ranging from single-celled bacteria to multicellular mammals. It is found in the nucleus of eukaryotes and in the organelles, chloroplasts, and mitochondria. In prokaryotes, the DNA is not enclosed in a membranous envelope.</p> <p id=\"fs-id811873\">The entire genetic content of a cell is known as its genome, and the study of genomes is genomics. In eukaryotic cells but not in prokaryotes, DNA forms a complex with histone proteins to form chromatin, the substance of eukaryotic chromosomes. A chromosome may contain tens of thousands of genes. Many genes contain the information to make protein products; other genes code for RNA products. DNA controls all of the cellular activities by turning the genes &#8220;on&#8221; or &#8220;off.&#8221;</p> <p id=\"fs-id1998871\">The other type of nucleic acid, RNA, is mostly involved in protein synthesis. The DNA molecules never leave the nucleus but instead use an intermediary to communicate with the rest of the cell. This intermediary is the <span data-type=\"term\">messenger RNA (mRNA)</span>. Other types of RNA&#8212;like rRNA, tRNA, and microRNA&#8212;are involved in protein synthesis and its regulation.</p> <p id=\"fs-id2904548\">DNA and RNA are made up of monomers known as <span data-type=\"term\">nucleotides</span>. The nucleotides combine with each other to form a <span data-type=\"term\">polynucleotide</span>, DNA or RNA. Each nucleotide is made up of three components: a nitrogenous base, a pentose (five-carbon) sugar, and a phosphate group (<a href=\"#fs-id1167066825544\" class=\"autogenerated-content\">[link]</a>). Each nitrogenous base in a nucleotide is attached to a sugar molecule, which is attached to one or more phosphate groups.</p><figure id=\"fs-id1167066825544\" class=\"ost-tag-lo-apbio-ch03-s05-lo01 ost-tag-lo-apbio-ch03-s05-lo02 ost-tag-std-apbio-lo-4-1 ost-tag-std-apbio-lo-4-2\"><figcaption>A nucleotide is made up of three components: a nitrogenous base, a pentose sugar, and one or more phosphate groups. Carbon residues in the pentose are numbered 1&#8242; through 5&#8242; (the prime distinguishes these residues from those in the base, which are numbered without using a prime notation). The base is attached to the 1&#8242; position of the ribose, and the phosphate is attached to the 5&#8242; position. When a polynucleotide is formed, the 5&#8242; phosphate of the incoming nucleotide attaches to the 3&#8242; hydroxyl group at the end of the growing chain. Two types of pentose are found in nucleotides, deoxyribose (found in DNA) and ribose (found in RNA). Deoxyribose is similar in structure to ribose, but it has an H instead of an OH at the 2&#8242; position. Bases can be divided into two categories: purines and pyrimidines. Purines have a double ring structure, and pyrimidines have a single ring.</figcaption> <span data-type=\"media\" id=\"fs-id1477162\" data-alt=\"The molecular structure of a nucleotide is shown.

They are bases because they contain an amino group that has the potential of binding an extra hydrogen, and thus, decreases the hydrogen ion concentration in its environment, making it more basic. Each nucleotide in DNA contains one of four possible nitrogenous bases: adenine (A), guanine (G) cytosine (C), and thymine (T).</p> <p id=\"fs-id1354194\">Adenine and guanine are classified as <span data-type=\"term\">purines</span>. The primary structure of a purine is two carbon-nitrogen rings. Cytosine, thymine, and uracil are classified as <span data-type=\"term\">pyrimidines</span> which have a single carbon-nitrogen ring as their primary structure (<a href=\"#fs-id1167066825544\" class=\"autogenerated-content\">[link]</a>). Each of these basic carbon-nitrogen rings has different functional groups attached to it. In molecular biology shorthand, the nitrogenous bases are simply known by their symbols A, T, G, C, and U. DNA contains A, T, G, and C whereas RNA contains A, U, G, and C.</p><p id=\"fs-id1445473\">The pentose sugar in DNA is deoxyribose, and in RNA, the sugar is ribose (<a href=\"#fs-id1167066825544\" class=\"autogenerated-content\">[link]</a>). The difference between the sugars is the presence of the hydroxyl group on the second carbon of the ribose and hydrogen on the second carbon of the deoxyribose. The carbon atoms of the sugar molecule are numbered as 1&#8242;, 2&#8242;, 3&#8242;, 4&#8242;, and 5&#8242; (1&#8242; is read as &#8220;one prime&#8221;). The phosphate residue is attached to the hydroxyl group of the 5&#8242; carbon of one sugar and the hydroxyl group of the 3&#8242; carbon of the sugar of the next nucleotide, which forms a 5&#8242;&#8211;3&#8242; <span data-type=\"term\">phosphodiester</span> linkage. The phosphodiester linkage is not formed by simple dehydration reaction like the other linkages connecting monomers in macromolecules: its formation involves the removal of two phosphate groups.

Every base pair in the double helivx is separated from the next base pair by 0.34 nm. The two strands of the helix run in opposite directions, meaning that the 5&#8242; carbon end of one strand will face the 3&#8242; carbon end of its matching strand.

This means A can pair with T, and G can pair with C, as shown in <a href=\"#fs-id1167063481030\" class=\"autogenerated-content\">[link]</a>. This is known as the base complementary rule. In other words, the DNA strands are complementary to each other. If the sequence of one strand is AATTGGCC, the complementary strand would have the sequence TTAACCGG.

The first, mRNA, carries the message from DNA, which controls all of the cellular activities in a cell. If a cell requires a certain protein to be synthesized, the gene for this product is turned &#8220;on&#8221; and the messenger RNA is synthesized in the nucleus. The RNA base sequence is complementary to the coding sequence of the DNA from which it has been copied. However, in RNA, the base T is absent and U is present instead. If the DNA strand has a sequence AATTGCGC, the sequence of the complementary RNA is UUAACGCG. In the cytoplasm, the mRNA interacts with ribosomes and other cellular machinery (<a href=\"#fs-id1167067199541\" class=\"autogenerated-content\">[link]</a>).</p><figure id=\"fs-id1167067199541\" class=\"ost-tag-lo-apbio-ch03-s05-lo03 ost-tag-std-apbio-lo-4-1 ost-tag-std-apbio-lo-4-2\"><figcaption>A ribosome has two parts: a large subunit and a small subunit.

Each codon codes for a single amino acid. In this way, the mRNA is read and the protein product is made. <span data-type=\"term\">Ribosomal RNA (rRNA)</span> is a major constituent of ribosomes on which the mRNA binds. The rRNA ensures the proper alignment of the mRNA and the ribosomes; the rRNA of the ribosome also has an enzymatic activity (peptidyl transferase) and catalyzes the formation of the peptide bonds between two aligned amino acids. <span data-type=\"term\">Transfer RNA (tRNA)</span> is one of the smallest of the four types of RNA, usually 70&#8211;90 nucleotides long. It carries the correct amino acid to the site of protein synthesis. It is the base pairing between the tRNA and mRNA that allows for the correct amino acid to be inserted in the polypeptide chain. microRNAs are the smallest RNA molecules and their role involves the regulation of gene expression by interfering with the expression of certain mRNA messages. <a href=\"#tab-ch03-05-01\" class=\"autogenerated-content\">[link]</a> summarizes features of DNA and RNA.</p> <table id=\"tab-ch03-05-01\" summary=\"\" class=\"ost-tag-lo-apbio-ch03-s05-lo01 ost-get-exercise\"><thead> <tr> <th colspan=\"3\" data-align=\"left\">Features of DNA and RNA</th> </tr> <tr> <th/> <th>DNA</th> <th>  RNA</th> </tr> </thead><tbody> <tr><td>Function</td><td>Carries genetic information</td><td>Involved in protein synthesis</td></tr> <tr><td>Location</td><td>Remains in the nucleus</td><td>Leaves the nucleus</td></tr> <tr><td>Structure</td><td>Double helix</td><td>Usually single-stranded</td></tr> <tr><td>Sugar</td><td>Deoxyribose</td><td>Ribose</td></tr> <tr><td>Pyrimidines</td><td>Cytosine, thymine</td><td>Cytosine, uracil</td></tr> <tr><td>Purines</td><td>Adenine, guanine</td><td>Adenine, guanine</td></tr> </tbody></table> <p id=\"fs-id1569149\">Even though the RNA is single stranded, most RNA types show extensive intramolecular base pairing between complementary sequences, creating a predictable three-dimensional structure essential for their function.</p> <p id=\"fs-id1438288\">As you have learned, information flow in an organism takes place from DNA to RNA to protein.

Each nucleotide is made up of a pentose sugar, a nitrogenous base, and a phosphate group. There are two types of nucleic acids: DNA and RNA. DNA carries the genetic blueprint of the cell and is passed on from parents to offspring (in the form of chromosomes). It has a double-helical structure with the two strands running in opposite directions, connected by hydrogen bonds, and complementary to each other. RNA is single-stranded and is made of a pentose sugar (ribose), a nitrogenous base, and a phosphate group. RNA is involved in protein synthesis and its regulation. Messenger RNA (mRNA) is copied from the DNA, is exported from the nucleus to the cytoplasm, and contains information for the construction of proteins. Ribosomal RNA (rRNA) is a part of the ribosomes at the site of protein synthesis, whereas transfer RNA (tRNA) carries the amino acid to the site of protein synthesis. microRNA regulates the use of mRNA for protein synthesis.</p> </section> <section data-depth=\"1\" id=\"fs-id1167066834517\" class=\"ost-reading-discard ost-chapter-review review\"><h1 data-type=\"title\">Review Questions</h1><div data-type=\"exercise\" id=\"fs-id1167066860360\" class=\"exercise os-exercise\"> <div data-type=\"problem\" class=\"problem\" id=\"fs-id1167066876487\"> <p id=\"fs-id1167067191306\"> <a href=\"#ost/api/ex/apbio-ch03-ex073\" class=\"autogenerated-content\">[link]</a> </p> </div> </div> <div data-type=\"exercise\" id=\"fs-id1167066968040\" class=\"exercise os-exercise\"> <div data-type=\"problem\" class=\"problem\" id=\"fs-id1167063519004\"> <p id=\"fs-id1167066782972\"> <a href=\"#ost/api/ex/apbio-ch03-ex074\" class=\"autogenerated-content\">[link]</a> </p> </div> </div> <div data-type=\"exercise\" id=\"fs-id1167066993637\" class=\"exercise os-exercise\"> <div data-type=\"problem\" class=\"problem\" id=\"fs-id1167067158323\"> <p id=\"fs-id1167063523038\"> <a href=\"#ost/api/ex/apbio-ch03-ex075\" class=\"autogenerated-content\">[link]</a> </p> </div> </div> <div data-type=\"exercise\" id=\"fs-id1167063606125\" class=\"exercise os-exercise\"> <div data-type=\"problem\" class=\"problem\" id=\"fs-id1167066806627\"> <p id=\"fs-id1167066849010\"> <a href=\"#ost/api/ex/apbio-ch03-ex076\" class=\"autogenerated-content\">[link]</a> </p> </div> </div> <div data-type=\"exercise\" id=\"fs-id1167067139129\" class=\"exercise os-exercise\"> <div data-type=\"problem\" class=\"problem\" id=\"fs-id1167066843376\"> <p id=\"fs-id1167066874580\"> <a href=\"#ost/api/ex/apbio-ch03-ex077\" class=\"autogenerated-content\">[link]</a> </p> </div> </div> <div data-type=\"exercise\" id=\"fs-id1167067072885\" class=\"exercise os-exercise\"> <div data-type=\"problem\" class=\"problem\" id=\"fs-id1167067061335\"> <p id=\"fs-id1167066955202\"> <a href=\"#ost/api/ex/apbio-ch03-ex078\" class=\"autogenerated-content\">[link]</a> </p> </div> </div> </section><section data-depth=\"1\" id=\"fs-id1167067153210\" class=\"ost-reading-discard ost-chapter-review critical-thinking\"><h1 data-type=\"title\">Critical Thinking Questions</h1> <div data-type=\"exercise\" id=\"fs-id1167066940024\" class=\"exercise os-exercise\"> <div data-type=\"problem\" class=\"problem\" id=\"fs-id1167066862661\"> <p id=\"fs-id1167067066861\"> <a href=\"#ost/api/ex/apbio-ch03-ex079\" class=\"autogenerated-content\">[link]</a> </p> </div> </div> <div data-type=\"exercise\" id=\"fs-id1167067111017\" class=\"exercise os-exercise\"> <div data-type=\"problem\" class=\"problem\" id=\"fs-id1167066848135\"> <p id=\"fs-id1167067151273\"> <a href=\"#ost/api/ex/apbio-ch03-ex080\" class=\"autogenerated-content\">[link]</a> </p> </div> </div> <div data-type=\"exercise\" id=\"fs-id1167063608890\" class=\"exercise os-exercise\"> <div data-type=\"problem\" class=\"problem\" id=\"fs-id1167067006416\"> <p id=\"fs-id1167067104375\"> <a href=\"#ost/api/ex/apbio-ch03-ex081\" class=\"autogenerated-content\">[link]</a> </p> </div> </div> </section> <div data-type=\"glossary\"><h2 data-type=\"glossary-title\">Glossary</h2> <dl class=\"definition\" id=\"fs-id2138705\"><dt>deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA)</dt> <dd id=\"fs-id2046936\">double-helical molecule that carries the hereditary information of the cell</dd></dl> <dl class=\"definition\" id=\"fs-id2570918\"><dt>messenger RNA (mRNA)</dt> <dd id=\"fs-id1957585\">RNA that carries information from DNA to ribosomes during protein synthesis</dd></dl> <dl class=\"definition\" id=\"fs-id2491136\"><dt>nucleic acid</dt> <dd id=\"fs-id2491445\">biological macromolecule that carries the genetic blueprint of a cell and carries instructions for the functioning of the cell</dd></dl> <dl class=\"definition\" id=\"fs-id2229589\"><dt>nucleotide</dt> <dd id=\"fs-id2054731\">monomer of nucleic acids;
